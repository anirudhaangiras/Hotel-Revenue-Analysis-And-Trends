# Hotel Revenue Analysis and Booking Trends: Unveiling Insights with SQL and Power BI

In this data-driven project, we explore a comprehensive hotel revenue dataset spanning three years (2018, 2019, and 2020). By leveraging SQL and Power BI, we dive into various business questions to uncover valuable insights and booking trends. Through SQL queries, we analyze the overall hotel revenue, cancellation rates, ADR, and booking lead time. We further investigate how factors such as hotel type, customer type, and the total number of special requests influence these metrics.

Combining data from multiple tables, we delve into market segments and meal costs, examining their impact on hotel revenue and booking patterns. The SQL analyses lead us to design a dynamic Power BI dashboard, showcasing intuitive visualizations and interactive elements. The dashboard visually presents our findings, enabling stakeholders to explore hotel performance, customer preferences, and revenue drivers with ease.
