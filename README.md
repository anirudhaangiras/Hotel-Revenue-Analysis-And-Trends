# Hotel Revenue Analysis and Booking Trends: Unveiling Insights with SQL and Power BI
This data-driven project explores a comprehensive hotel revenue dataset spanning three years (2018, 2019, and 2020). We dive into various business questions by leveraging SQL and Power BI to uncover valuable insights and booking trends. We analyze the overall hotel revenue, cancellation rates, ADR, and booking lead time through SQL queries. We investigate how hotel type, customer type, and the total number of special requests influence these metrics.

Combining data from multiple tables, we delve into market segments and meal costs, examining their impact on hotel revenue and booking patterns. The SQL analyses led us to design a dynamic Power BI dashboard, showcasing intuitive visualizations and interactive elements. The dashboard visually presents our findings, enabling stakeholders to easily explore hotel performance, customer preferences, and revenue drivers.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindkrishnadas/hotel-revenue). It consists of hotel booking, and room rate cost data from 2018, 2019, and 2020, along with additional tables containing market segment information and meal costs.

## SQL Analysis
The project addresses the following key business questions:

**1. What is the cancellation rate, and does it vary based on various factors?**
